# Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Phillip Burrows and I am an Geospatial Analyst at the Govenrment of Canada. 
Here you will find a small sample of the projects I am working on, mostly coursework from FreeCodeCamp for the time being.

## About me:
I have a masters degree in geographic information systems and a BA in human geography and philosophy. I am passionate about Bitcoin, hoping one day to make contributions to Bitcoin Core as well as L2 solutions to facilitate hyperbitcoinization. For the moment I am steering my career in the direction of software development by focusing on skill building.
